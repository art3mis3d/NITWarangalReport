  abstract = "AutoDock Vina, a new program for molecular docking and virtual
              screening, is presented. AutoDock Vina achieves an approximately
              two orders of magnitude speed-up compared with the molecular
              docking software previously developed in our lab (AutoDock 4),
              while also significantly improving the accuracy of the binding
              mode predictions, judging by our tests on the training set used
              in AutoDock 4 development. Further speed-up is achieved from
              parallelism, by using multithreading on multicore machines.
              AutoDock Vina automatically calculates the grid maps and clusters
              the results in a way transparent to the user.",
