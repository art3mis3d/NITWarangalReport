  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia
              worldwide, and its prevalence is rapidly increasing due to
              extended lifespans. Among the increasing number of genetic risk
              factors identified, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene remains the
              strongest and most prevalent, impacting more than half of all AD
              cases. While the $\epsilon$4 allele of the APOE gene
              significantly increases AD risk, the $\epsilon$2 allele is
              protective relative to the common $\epsilon$3 allele. These gene
              alleles encode three apoE protein isoforms that differ at two
              amino acid positions. The primary physiological function of apoE
              is to mediate lipid transport in the brain and periphery;
              however, additional functions of apoE in diverse biological
              functions have been recognized. Pathogenically, apoE seeds
              amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) plaques in the brain with apoE4
              driving earlier and more abundant amyloids. ApoE isoforms also
              have differential effects on multiple A$\beta$-related or
              A$\beta$-independent pathways. The complexity of apoE biology and
              pathobiology presents challenges to designing effective
              apoE-targeted therapeutic strategies. This review examines the
              key pathobiological pathways of apoE and related targeting
              strategies with a specific focus on the latest technological
              advances and tools.},
