  abstract = "To facilitate clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies for
              Alzheimer's disease, which are expected to be most efficacious at
              the earliest and mildest stages of the disease, supportive
              biomarker information is necessary. The only validated methods
              for identifying amyloid-$\beta$ deposition in the brain-the
              earliest pathological signature of Alzheimer's disease-are
              amyloid-$\beta$ positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging or
              measurement of amyloid-$\beta$ in cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore,
              a minimally invasive, cost-effective blood-based biomarker is
              desirable. Despite much effort, to our knowledge, no study has
              validated the clinical utility of blood-based amyloid-$\beta$
              markers. Here we demonstrate the measurement of high-performance
              plasma amyloid-$\beta$ biomarkers by immunoprecipitation coupled
              with mass spectrometry. The ability of amyloid-$\beta$ precursor
              protein (APP)(669-711)/amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)(1-42) and
              A$\beta$(1-40)/A$\beta$(1-42) ratios, and their composites, to
              predict individual brain amyloid-$\beta$-positive or -negative
              status was determined by amyloid-$\beta$-PET imaging and tested
              using two independent data sets: a discovery data set (Japan, n =
              121) and a validation data set (Australia, n = 252 including 111
              individuals diagnosed using (11)C-labelled Pittsburgh compound-B
              (PIB)-PET and 141 using other ligands). Both data sets included
              cognitively normal individuals, individuals with mild cognitive
              impairment and individuals with Alzheimer's disease. All test
              biomarkers showed high performance when predicting brain
              amyloid-$\beta$ burden. In particular, the composite biomarker
              showed very high areas under the receiver operating
              characteristic curves (AUCs) in both data sets (discovery,
              96.7\%, n = 121 and validation, 94.1\%, n = 111) with an accuracy
              approximately equal to 90\% when using PIB-PET as a standard of
              truth. Furthermore, test biomarkers were correlated with
              amyloid-$\beta$-PET burden and levels of A$\beta$(1-42) in
              cerebrospinal fluid. These results demonstrate the potential
              clinical utility of plasma biomarkers in predicting brain
              amyloid-$\beta$ burden at an individual level. These plasma
              biomarkers also have cost-benefit and scalability advantages over
              current techniques, potentially enabling broader clinical access
              and efficient population screening.",
